- **Multi-Model AI System**: Intelligent assistance across all platform features

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Next.js, Styled Components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with SQL schemas)
- **AI/ML**: Custom-built multi-model AI system
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/unified-platform.git
cd unified-platform
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the frontend (Next.js) and backend (Express) servers concurrently.

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

## Demo Preview

The current implementation includes:

- Homepage with feature showcase
- Main layout with navigation
- Authentication system (frontend context and backend API)
- Multi-model AI system foundation
- Mock API endpoints for social, e-commerce, e-learning, and job features
