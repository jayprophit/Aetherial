Build and create me a artificial intelligence program that is responsible for trades and supplies.  Meaning for example if you have a construction company and take on a job you will need materials based on the design and specifications.  I want to design a program that will search for suppliers.  It will start with continent, country, state, borough, district, area, street, then number.  This will be for the closest in the local area to the job working site or location.  Locate the supplies needed at the best needed quality at the cheapest price, also be  available for delivery or pick up.  Preferably delivery.  Then when supplies are low and need to be restocked then an order will be placed automatically and restock the missing supplies.  This program will work across all industries.  This means e-commerce, online shops, local shops, stores, business, factory, sole traders, ho hobbyists, clints, public etc.  This way the program is searching and bidding for the lowest price, ordering and delivering to you the supplies needed.  This also includes quality, quantity, availability and volume of stock.  This program will alow business b2b and clients b2c to be able to have sufficient and efficient delivery service and supplies.  It also has to search for delivering services for the supplies if the company or individual dosent not provide transportation or a delivery service.  also provide an option to manually select if the user has a preference.
