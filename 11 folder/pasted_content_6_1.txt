However, if it specifically involves scanning and mapping a human brain to replicate its exact neural connections and processes, it is commonly associated with concepts like:

Whole Brain Emulation (WBE): This refers to creating a digital replica of a human brain by scanning and modeling all its neural connections and functions. It's a theoretical approach aimed at replicating human consciousness and thought processes in a machine.
Neural Reconstruction: This term is used when scanning technologies (like fMRI or advanced imaging techniques) are utilized to study and reconstruct neural circuits for emulation in AI systems.
Connectomics: The mapping of all the neural connections in a brain, also known as the "connectome," which serves as a blueprint for replicating the brain's structure in AI.
Synthetic Cognition: A term used for AI systems designed to replicate cognitive functions inspired by human brain architecture.
The concept of scanning a human brain to model AI is deeply rooted in neuroscience and computational biology, and often overlaps with speculative fields like mind uploading or digital immortality. These ideas are still largely experimental and theoretical due to technological and ethical challenges.
