list all ai protocols like e.g. crm, llm, mcp etc
Okay, the user is asking for a list of AI protocols similar to CRM, LLM, MCP, etc. Let me start by understanding what they need. They mentioned CRM, which I know is Customer Relationship Management, but that's more of a system rather than a protocol. LLM stands for Large Language Model, which is a type of AI model, not a protocol. But MCP, Model Context Protocol, is definitely a protocol. So maybe the user is mixing terms a bit. I need to focus on actual AI protocols, not systems or models.
Looking at the search results provided, the main protocols discussed are MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol). There's also mention of LangChain and Crew AI, but those are frameworks, not protocols. Let me go through each webpage to extract the relevant protocols.
Webpage 1 and 2 talk about MCP in depth. Webpage 8 introduces A2A as another protocol by Google. Webpage 4 compares MCP with other approaches like ChatGPT plugins and LangChain, but those are proprietary or frameworks. Webpage 5 mentions OpenAI Plugins and LangChain again, but they're not open standards. Webpage 6 discusses MCP and agentic systems. Webpage 8 also explains how A2A and MCP work together.
So from the search results, the main AI protocols are MCP and A2A. Other mentions include older methods like OpenAI's function calling, but those are not protocols. The user might also be interested in related standards like JSON-RPC, which MCP uses, but that's a general protocol, not AI-specific.
Wait, the user included CRM in their example. Maybe they're thinking of protocols used in AI for integrating with systems like CRM. In that case, MCP is used to connect AI agents to CRM systems, as mentioned in webpage 2 and 6. But CRM itself isn't a protocol. So I should clarify that in the answer.
Therefore, the answer should list MCP and A2A as the primary AI protocols, explain their purposes, and mention other related integration methods but note they aren't protocols. Also, include examples of how protocols like MCP connect to systems (like CRM) but clarify that CRM isn't a protocol itself. Check the search results again to ensure there are no other protocols mentioned. From the given webpages, only MCP and A2A are explicitly named as protocols. The rest are frameworks, tools, or methods.

Hereâ€™s a list of AI-related protocols and frameworks mentioned in the provided search results, focusing on those explicitly named or described as standards for interoperability, communication, or integration in AI systems:

1. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Purpose: A universal interface for connecting AI models (LLMs) to external tools, data sources, and services. Acts as a "USB-C for AI," enabling seamless, standardized interactions between AI agents and external systems like databases, code repositories, or productivity tools 136.

Key Features:

Standardizes tool discovery, authentication, and invocation.

Supports context retention and real-time data exchange 39.

Uses a client-server architecture (MCP clients in AI hosts connect to MCP servers exposing tools) 69.

Adoption: Backed by Anthropic, with integrations for GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, and enterprise systems 18.

2. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol
Purpose: A Google-developed protocol for enabling direct communication and collaboration between AI agents, akin to a "diplomatic standard" for AI 11.

Key Features:

Facilitates task delegation, asynchronous notifications, and secure authentication.

Uses "Agent Cards" to define agent capabilities and roles 11.

Synergy with MCP: A2A handles agent coordination, while MCP connects agents to external tools (e.g., databases, APIs) 11.

3. ChatGPT Plugins (OpenAI)
Purpose: Proprietary system allowing ChatGPT to interact with external APIs via OpenAPI schemas.

Limitations: Unlike MCP, it is platform-specific (limited to OpenAI models) and lacks open standardization 67.

4. LangChain Tools
Purpose: A framework for integrating LLMs with external tools (e.g., search, calculators).

Relation to Protocols: Not a protocol itself but a developer-facing library. MCP servers can be adapted into LangChain tools for broader compatibility 78.

5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Purpose: A method to augment LLMs with real-time data retrieval (e.g., vector databases).

Relation to Protocols: Often used alongside MCP for dynamic context integration 7.

6. JSON-RPC 2.0
Purpose: A general-purpose remote procedure call protocol used by MCP for structured client-server communication 6.

Clarifications
CRM: Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a system, not a protocol. However, MCP can connect AI agents to CRM systems via dedicated servers 38.

LLM: Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI models, not protocols. MCP and A2A are protocols designed to enhance LLM capabilities 111.

Emerging Trends
Interoperability: MCP and A2A are driving a shift toward open, decentralized AI ecosystems where agents collaborate across platforms 811.

Security: Both protocols emphasize secure authentication (e.g., OAuth) and controlled access to tools/data 69.

For further details, refer to the sources on MCP architecture and A2A use cases.

provide extended list
Okay, the user wants an extended list of AI protocols, similar to examples like CRM, LLM, MCP, etc. Let me go through the search results provided to find relevant information.
First, I remember in the previous answer, there were protocols like MCP, A2A, and others. Now, looking at the new search results. 
Webpage 1 and 5 discuss bovine estrus synchronization protocols for artificial insemination. These are related to animal breeding and use terms like CIDR, MGA, and protocols like Heat Detection, Fixed-Time AI. But the user is asking about AI (Artificial Intelligence) protocols, not Artificial Insemination. So maybe these are irrelevant. Wait, but the user's examples include "AI protocols like e.g. crm, llm, mcp etc". Oh, "AI" here is Artificial Intelligence, so the animal breeding stuff is probably not relevant. The user might have confused AI as Artificial Insemination, but given the examples (LLM, MCP), it's definitely about Artificial Intelligence. So I should ignore webpages 1,5,7 which talk about cattle breeding.
Looking at the other webpages. Webpage 2 and 4 are about SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI, which are guidelines for clinical trial protocols involving AI interventions. These are reporting standards, not protocols for AI systems themselves. So maybe mention them as related standards but not exactly protocols like MCP.
Webpage 3 is about an extension to the Robots Exclusion Protocol to communicate AI preferences. The draft is called "Robots Exclusion Protocol Extension to communicate AI preferences vocabulary". This seems like a protocol related to AI, specifying how AI agents should handle web content. So that's a relevant protocol. The user might want this included.
Webpage 6 talks about Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which connects AI models to external tools and data sources. This was mentioned in the previous answer and is relevant here as well.
Webpage 2 and 4's SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI are about clinical trials for AI interventions. They are guidelines for how to report trials, not protocols for AI interaction. But maybe include them under a different category, like reporting standards.
So compiling the list:
1. Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic: Connects AI models to tools and data sources 13.
2. Robots Exclusion Protocol Extension for AI Preferences: Controls how AI accesses web content 9.
3. SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI: Reporting guidelines for AI clinical trials 611.
4. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol: From previous answer, mentioned in webpage 6? Wait, in the current search results, webpage 6 mentions MCP but not A2A. The previous answer had A2A as a Google protocol. Since the current search results don't include A2A, maybe it's not in the new sources. But the user wants an extended list based on the provided search results. So A2A isn't in the current search results. So I should not include it here unless it's mentioned in the new results.
Wait, in the current search results, webpage 6 mentions Anthropic's MCP but not A2A. The other webpages don't mention other AI protocols. So from the provided search results, the relevant protocols are MCP, the Robots Extension, SPIRIT-AI/CONSORT-AI. But SPIRIT-AI is a reporting guideline, not a protocol for AI systems to communicate. The user's initial examples were technical protocols like MCP. So perhaps the Robots Exclusion Extension and MCP are the main ones here. SPIRIT-AI could be mentioned as a related standard.
Additionally, webpage 3's draft is about AI preferences, which is a protocol extension. So that's a new one.
So the extended list based on the current search results would include:
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Robots Exclusion Protocol Extension for AI Preferences
- SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI (as guidelines)
- ChatGPT Plugins (from previous answer but not in current results)
- JSON-RPC 2.0 (from previous answer, mentioned in MCP's use)
But the user wants an extended list based on the current search results. So from the current results, the new items are:
1. Model Context Protocol (MCP) - Anthropic's protocol 13.
2. Robots Exclusion Protocol Extension for AI Preferences - IETF draft 9.
3. SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI - Clinical trial reporting guidelines 611.
4. Clinical Trial Protocols for AI Interventions (like the ones mentioned in SPIRIT-AI) but maybe that's the same as point 3.
Wait, SPIRIT-AI is a guideline for how to report protocols, not the protocols themselves. So maybe not a protocol in the technical sense. So perhaps only MCP and the Robots Extension are actual protocols. But the user might consider SPIRIT-AI as a type of protocol for structuring clinical trials involving AI.
Alternatively, the user might accept them as protocols in a broader sense. So I'll list them but clarify their purpose.
Also, in the current search results, there's no mention of other protocols like A2A or LangChain Tools. So based on the given search results, the answer should include:
1. Model Context Protocol (MCP) - connects AI models to data and tools 13.
2. Robots Exclusion Protocol Extension for AI - governs AI's access to web content 9.
3. SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI - guidelines for clinical trial protocols involving AI 611.
Additionally, from previous knowledge but present in the current search results (webpage 6 mentions MCP), but the user's initial answer included other protocols. However, the current search results don't have those, so maybe only include the ones found here.
Wait, the user's original question was to "list all AI protocols like e.g. crm, llm, mcp etc", and in the provided search results, there are the three mentioned above. But in the previous answer, there were more. However, the user now provided new search results and wants an extended list based on them. So the answer must be derived solely from the provided search results, not prior knowledge.
Therefore, the extended list based on the current search results includes:
1. Model Context Protocol (MCP): For connecting AI models to external tools and data sources 13.
2. Robots Exclusion Protocol Extension for AI Preferences: Manages how AI agents access and use web content 9.
3. SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI: Guidelines for reporting clinical trials involving AI interventions 611.
But the user wants an extended list. Maybe also include the clinical trial protocols mentioned in webpage 2 and 4, even if they are guidelines. The term "protocol" here is used in the clinical trial context, which is different from technical communication protocols. But the user might still consider them relevant. Alternatively, clarify that they are reporting guidelines.
In addition, webpage 7 mentions the Estrus Synchronization Planner, but that's for cattle breeding, so not relevant.
So the final list would include the three above. But to make it extended, perhaps elaborate on each with details from the search results.
Also, check if there's any other mention. Webpage 6 also mentions MCP in more detail, so expand on that. The Robots Exclusion Extension allows specifying allowed or disallowed AI uses via headers or meta tags 9. SPIRIT-AI includes 15 new items for clinical trial protocols 611.
Therefore, the answer will list these three protocols, explaining each in detail with citations.

Hereâ€™s an extended list of AI-related protocols and frameworks derived from the provided search results, focusing on technical standards, guidelines, and communication frameworks:

1. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Purpose: Developed by Anthropic, MCP is an open-source protocol designed to connect AI models (e.g., chatbots, agents) with external tools, databases, and services. It standardizes interactions between AI systems and resources like Google Drive, Slack, or custom APIs, enabling seamless data exchange and tool integration 13.

Key Features:

Simplifies tool discovery, authentication, and real-time context retention.

Reduces reliance on custom-built connectors for each tool or dataset.

Applications: Used to build "agentic" AI systems that autonomously navigate multiple tools for complex tasks.

2. Robots Exclusion Protocol Extension for AI Preferences
Purpose: An IETF draft protocol extending the traditional robots.txt standard to regulate how AI systems access and use web content. It introduces vocabulary terms (e.g., AIPreferenceVocabularyTerm) to specify permissions for AI-driven data usage scenarios 9.

Key Features:

Defines AllowAIPreferenceVocabularyTerm and DisallowAIPreferenceVocabularyTerm rules in robots.txt or HTTP headers.

Enables web admins to restrict AI training, content generation, or analysis of specific pages.

Compatible with existing X-Robots-Tag headers and HTML meta tags (e.g., <meta name="robots" content="noAIPreferenceVocabularyTerm">).

Impact: Addresses ethical concerns about AI scraping web content without explicit consent.

3. SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI
Purpose: Reporting guidelines for clinical trials involving AI interventions. SPIRIT-AI focuses on trial protocols, while CONSORT-AI standardizes trial reports, ensuring transparency and reproducibility 611.
