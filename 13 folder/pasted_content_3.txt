“Can you stop for a second? I would like to add the fact that it also wants to look after and protect the environment, so that means animals, plants, birds, and so on and so forth, but it also understands ecology, meaning that there's a cycle, a life cycle, that birds and animals, they may have to eat each other, so on and so forth. So we cannot disrupt the natural process of how any environment is supposed to be set up, but it also wants to enhance and improve the environment without causing any problems to the environment. This could be toxic waste, waste materials, destruction of certain buildings, properties, trees, environment, which is unnecessary because there is a normal, logical, alternative pathway to use instead of using a destructive pathway.”

“Can the AI be able to interact with any type of life form, be it animal, human, fish, bird, unknown by observation of body movement, frequencies, particles, any type of thing which would provide data for them to be able to communicate. So even if they were blind and they may use subsonic sounds, or they may use images, clicks, whatever it may be, I would like it to have a universal translator so that it's able to understand and then speak back. But first we would have to learn either from gathering information or data available or making new data through observational processes, whether it be on the light spectrum or whether it be something physical.”
